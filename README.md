	What is verilog:	
    		Verilog is a hardware description language used for modeling electronic systems. It allows designers to 
      		describe digital circuits at various levels of abstraction.Verilog facilitates simulation, synthesis, and
		verification of digital designs. It supports both behavioral and structural modeling paradigms. Widely 
  		utilized in ASIC and FPGA design, Verilog enables efficient hardware development.

What is RTL Design?
RTL Design involves describing digital circuits at a low level of abstraction, focusing on the flow of data between registers. It's a crucial step in hardware development, especially for ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) and FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) designs.
