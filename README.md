# Verilog_RTL
  Verilog is a hardware description language used for modeling electronic systems. It allows designers to describe digital circuits at various levels of abstraction. Verilog facilitates simulation, synthesis, and verification of digital designs. It supports both behavioral and structural modeling paradigms. Widely utilized in ASIC and FPGA design, Verilog enables efficient hardware development.
